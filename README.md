## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this challenge I practiced a form validation and worked with css selectors. Working with forms is a very important part in web development. We are getting and sending a lot of data to make our applications much more useful for users. Sending data between applications makes application vulnerable at malicious code so, it was good opportunity to read about this kind of stuff.

### Continued development

This time form was a very basic one with just one input. I know we actually don't have to send data to a server so, it was more focused on simple validation. In a future I definitely want to work with much complicated forms of sending data and validate forms in more secure way.
